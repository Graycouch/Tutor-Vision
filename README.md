1. You have to download node.js, so that you can launch the projects and use a command called npm: you can find the download link here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Then either by directly downloading the code or using github desktop, you pull the repository onto your computer

3. You then download visual studio code and on the left bar there's this tab called extensions, download npm from there, you can find visual studio code here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

4. Once you have visual studio code and npm downloaded, you then want to open the "Tutor-Vision" folder in vs code, the "Tutor-Vision" folder is in the repository that you pulled from github

5. You should now have all the code available on visual studio code, you then want to open two terminals within vs code and cd into the node-rest-api folder in one of the terminals and then cd into the react-app-design folder in the second one

6. Starting with the node-rest-api one you type npm install and then npm start, you then type npm install react-scripts --save into the react-app-design one and then npm start into it as well, so that the project is hosted using expo

7. To view the project on your phone you have to download expo go from the app store and then scan the QR code that is in vs code using the app

8. Everything should be set up now and you should be able to start coding and see the changes in real time. You need to repeat steps 5 and 6 every time you want to launch the project
